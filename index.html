                   <p>Building blocks. Cars and trucks. Shape sorters and puzzles. These toys have stood the test of time – captivating children as effectively today as they have for decades.
                    Automoblox has taken valuable elements from each of these classic toys to create a fresh line of modular wooden vehicles that allows children to create their own car styles.
                    Automoblox has merged the fun factor of classic car toys with the warmth of natural wood, richly colored roofs and bright rubber tires to create a design system that stimulates creative thinking and excites the tactile and visual senses of children at any age. And by combining the open-ended play of wooden blocks with the cognitive challenges of shape sorters and puzzles, Automoblox has created a play system loaded with the healthy developmental benefits that are so necessary for today’s kids.
                    
                    American designer Patrick Calello came up with the idea for Automoblox while studying industrial design at Carnegie Mellon University. A combination of his passions for design and automobiles, Calello’s vision for Automoblox is to create a toy that inspires the next generation of great thinkers and creators.
                    With a design portfolio that ranges from consumer products to high-end electronics to Broadway marques and Columbia Records platinum albums, holding dozens of US and International patents, Calello infused Automoblox with resources to help children develop their own unique sense of style and design confidence. Every Automoblox car is marked <q>Designed by Calello</q> as a testament to the pride that went into creating one of the most innovative toys of this generation.</p>

                  <p>Every child is an individual with a unique sense of creativity and style. The creation of something new and unique – born of a child’s imagination – is the idea behind Automoblox.
                    There are plenty of building and assembly toys on the market that include instructions and illustrations to help children build the product that is pictured on the box. With Automoblox, kids play “outside the box” – assembling the unique designs pictured in their own mind’s eye.
                    
                    Automoblox designer, Patrick Calello worked closely with leading child development psychologists to create a play experience with sound educational value. With Automoblox, a child learns goal directed activity through which knowledge is acquired by coordinating the following.</p>

                    <strong>Visio-spatial processing.</strong>
                    By playing with the Automoblox, a child can discover how they perceive shapes and part-towhole relationships by putting the puzzle pieces together. They will begin to use skills such as rotation, integration and see angles to accurately differentiate between shapes and and how they can build and design their own cars.</p>

                    <strong>Creative problem solving.</strong>
                    Creative problem solving skills develop as your child is able to formulate new ideas and produce a variety of responses (or different combinations to create new car designs). Automoblox helps in developing planning skills. Creativity involves originality, flexibility, independence and playfulness.</p>

                    <strong>Gross and fine motor skills.</strong>
                    Gross and Fine Motor Skills develops and exercises a child’s sensory and motor modalities. Automoblox promotes the development of the ability to coordinate precise hand and visual movements, precise movements of the arms, hands and fingers and the ability to develop finger dexterity and speed of motor movements.</p>
